This is my first website project, built with html, css and javascript.
It's purely fontend, well am still currently a junior fontend dev so its sort of a publication of my work, with time as I evolve into a senior fontend dev I will upload more complexe projects. 
First we have the nav bar which is set fixed(on scrolling), in it is a search section(visit the code to see more).
Secondly is a slider container, i implimented a manual logic for it. like next button and previour button to glide.
Thirdly is a flex container containing a series of images. Well i haven't added a dynamicity for this section yet.
Stay tuned for more.....
